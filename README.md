Processing code is stored in the subfolder /scripts. This folder also contains the file `code_instructions.md`, which contains information of how to run the code.

The result scenes shown in the publication can be opened using Connectome Workbench's wb_view. The result scenes are stored in the file `project_msm_figures/MSMstuff/project_msm_figures.scene`.
Data files underlying the result scene files are stored in other subfolders. In order to be able to view the result scene files, the whole repository needs to be cloned so that the references to the data files remain valid.
